According to these racial laws, a Jew is someone with three or more Jewish grandparents or a person with two Jewish grandparents who identifies as Jewish through religious practice or cultural affiliation.

The ceremony is attended by U.S. General Douglas MacArthur, who oversees the proceedings, and representatives of the Allied nations. Japan's surrender follows the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August, as well as the Soviet Union's declaration of war. The end of the war marks the beginning of a new geopolitical order, with the United States and the Soviet Union emerging as superpowers. The world begins efforts to rebuild, while the horrors of the Holocaust and war crimes trials shape postwar justice .

According to these racial laws, a Jew is someone with three or more Jewish grandparents or a person with two Jewish grandparents who identifies as Jewish through religious practice or cultural affiliation. These laws institutionalized discrimination against Jews, stripping them of German citizenship and prohibiting intermarriage between Jews and non-Jews. This legal framework lays the foundation for further persecution, isolating Jews from the rest of society and preparing for the more radical policies of exclusion and extermination that would follow in the coming years.

The evacuation aims to prevent the liberation of prisoners who could testify to the Nazis' crimes. When Soviet troops arrive at Auschwitz on January 27, they find only 7,000 survivors, mostly sick and dying. The liberation of Auschwitz exposes the full horror of Nazi atrocities, with gas chambers, crematoria, and mass graves revealing the scale of genocide.

                Auschwitz is behind me now, but the nightmare is far from over. We left in the freezing darkness three days ago, forced to march through the snow with no food, no rest, only the crack of whips and the sharp bite of the cold keeping us moving. I saw men fall beside me, their bodies collapsing into the snow, lifeless before they hit the ground. The SS did not hesitate—they shot anyone who could not keep up. The snow was stained red.
                
                I do not know how I am still standing. My feet are numb, my stomach a hollow pit. My father is with me, but he is weak. His breathing is labored, and I fear he will not last much longer. I try to support him, to give him my strength, but I have so little left to give the others were right but I still give.
                
                I no longer pray. The words feel empty now. Where was God when we were herded like cattle? Where was He when my mother and little sister were taken from me forever? There is nothing left but survival.
                
                I do not know where they are taking us, only that the march does not end. We walk, and we fall, and we die, and those still standing continue forward.
                
                I am afraid to sleep. I know that if I close my eyes, I may never open them again.
